# Pay-n-Play Telegram Bot

A production-ready Telegram bot that routes buy-ins to either pending cash-outs from a Google Sheet (instant match) or the club owner (fallback).

## Features

- **Client-proof**: Works with any existing Google Sheet layout
- **Smart matching**: Matches buy-ins to pending cash-outs by amount and payment method
- **Min $20 remainder rule**: Ensures partial settlements leave either $0 or â‰¥$20 remaining
- **Group workflow**: Posts transaction cards to loader group for verification
- **Restricted Mark Paid**: Only owners/loaders can confirm payments
- **ClubGG integration**: Optional webhook for auto-loading chips
- **Flexible deployment**: Supports webhook on Railway and long polling locally
- **Owner fallback**: Routes to owner when no match is found or amount exceeds threshold

## Tech Stack

- Node 20, TypeScript, ESM
- grammy for Telegram bot
- express for webhook server
- googleapis (Sheets v4) for Google Sheets integration
- npm package manager

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Google Service Account

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Google Sheets API
4. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
5. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
6. Download the JSON key file
7. Extract `client_email` and `private_key` from the JSON

### 2. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` and follow instructions
3. Copy the bot token

### 3. Prepare Google Sheet

1. Create a new Google Sheet or use existing one
2. Share the sheet with your service account email (with Editor permissions)
3. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SHEET_ID}/edit`

### 4. Set up Group Workflow

1. **Create a loader group** in Telegram (owners + loaders + optional players)
2. **Add the bot** to the group
3. **Get the group ID**: Send a message in the group and visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates` to find the `chat.id`
4. **Set LOADER_GROUP_ID** to the numeric group ID (usually negative number like `-1001234567890`)
5. **Configure OWNER_IDS and LOADER_IDS** with comma-separated Telegram user IDs
6. **Set BOT_USERNAME** to your bot's username (without @)

**Optional**: Disable privacy mode in BotFather (`/setprivacy` â†’ "Turn off") to allow the bot to see non-command messages in groups for better onboarding.

### 5. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables (create .env file)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 6. Railway Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - All required variables above
   - Set `BASE_URL` to your Railway app URL (e.g., https://your-app.up.railway.app)

3. Deploy using Nixpacks (automatic)

4. After deployment, verify webhook:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
   ```
   Should show webhook URL pointing to `BASE_URL/<BOT_TOKEN>`

## Usage

### Bot Commands

- `/start` - Welcome message with Buy-In button
- `/ping` - Health check (returns "pong âœ…")

### User Flow

1. User sends `/start` (in DM or group)
2. Bot shows welcome message with "ðŸ’¸ Buy-In" button
3. User clicks Buy-In â†’ shows payment methods
4. User selects method â†’ shows amount options ($25, $50, $75, $100, $200, Custom)
5. User selects amount â†’ bot tries to match with pending cash-out
6. Bot replies to player with payment instructions
7. Bot posts transaction card to loader group with "âœ… Mark Paid" button
8. Player posts screenshot proof in group
9. Loader/Owner clicks "âœ… Mark Paid" to confirm payment
10. Sheet is updated and ClubGG webhook is called (if configured)

## Google Sheet Layout

The bot is client-proof and works with various sheet layouts:

### Settings Tab (Optional)
If present, should have columns:
- `key` | `value`
- `CLUB_NAME` | Your Club Name
- `METHODS_ENABLED` | ZELLE,VENMO
- `CURRENCY` | USD
- `FAST_FEE_PCT` | 0.02
- `OWNER_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD` | 999999
- `OWNER_TG_USERNAME` | username

### OwnerAccounts Tab (Optional)
If present, should have columns:
- `method` | `handle` | `display_name` | `instructions`
- `ZELLE` | `your@email.com` | `Owner` | `Include note with payment`

### Cashouts Tab (Optional)
If present, should have columns:
- `cashout_id` | `method` | `amount` | `status` | `receiver_handle`

### Fallback: First Sheet
If no dedicated tabs, bot infers from first sheet:
- Looks for columns: Transaction Type, Payment Method, Amount, Status
- Treats rows with "cash out" in Transaction Type as cash-outs
- Treats empty/pending/open Status as pending

### Roles Sheet (Optional)
If a tab named "Roles" exists with headers:
- `tg_user_id` (number) - Telegram user ID
- `role` (owner|loader) - User role
- `display_name` (optional) - Display name

These roles are merged with environment variables (sheet takes precedence).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**400 "Unable to parse range"**
- Missing tab; auto-fallback should handle this
- Check sheet permissions

**403 Permission denied**
- Share sheet with service account email
- Ensure service account has Editor permissions

**502 from Telegram**
- Check Railway logs
- Often indicates Sheets API error
- Verify all environment variables are set

### Manual Testing

1. Hit `/` â†’ should return "OK"
2. Send `/ping` in Telegram â†’ should return "pong âœ…"
3. Send `/start` â†’ should show welcome + Buy-In button
4. Complete buy-in flow â†’ should post to loader group
5. Test Mark Paid authorization â†’ only privileged users can confirm
6. Add bot to group â†’ should post welcome message
