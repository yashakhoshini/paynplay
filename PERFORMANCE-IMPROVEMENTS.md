# Bot Performance Improvements

## Problem Identified

The bot was experiencing significant slowness when users pressed buttons, with delays of several seconds. This was caused by:

1. **Multiple Google Sheets API calls on every interaction**
   - `/start` command called `getSettings()`
   - "Buy-In" button called both `getSettings()` AND `getOwnerAccounts()`
   - Amount selection called both functions again in `handleAmount()`

2. **Google Sheets API limitations**
   - Rate limiting: 100 requests per 100 seconds per user
   - Network latency for each API call
   - Authentication overhead for each request

3. **No caching mechanism**
   - Every button press triggered fresh API calls
   - Same data was fetched repeatedly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added In-Memory Caching

```typescript
// Cache for Google Sheets data to improve performance
interface CachedData {
  settings: any;
  owners: any[];
  lastUpdated: number;
}

const sheetsCache: CachedData = {
  settings: null,
  owners: [],
  lastUpdated: 0
};

const CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes cache TTL
```

### 2. Cached Functions

- `getCachedSettings()` - Returns cached settings or fetches from sheets
- `getCachedOwnerAccounts()` - Returns cached owner accounts or fetches from sheets
- Both functions include performance logging to monitor improvements

### 3. Cache Invalidation

- Cache is invalidated when data changes (marking payments as paid, confirming withdrawals)
- Periodic cache refresh every 5 minutes to ensure data freshness
- Manual cache invalidation via `invalidateCache()` function

### 4. Performance Monitoring

Added detailed logging to track:
- Cache hits vs. API calls
- Response times for each operation
- Cache refresh operations

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before (No Caching)
- **First button press**: 2-5 seconds (API calls)
- **Subsequent button presses**: 2-5 seconds (repeated API calls)
- **Total API calls per user session**: 6-10 calls

### After (With Caching)
- **First button press**: 2-5 seconds (API calls + cache population)
- **Subsequent button presses**: 50-200ms (cache hits)
- **Total API calls per user session**: 2 calls (initial load)

### Performance Gains
- **90-95% reduction** in response time for cached operations
- **60-80% reduction** in total API calls
- **Better user experience** with near-instant button responses

## Cache Behavior

### Cache Hit (Fast)
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [ClubBot] Settings served from cache (2ms)
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [ClubBot] Owner accounts served from cache (1ms)
```

### Cache Miss (Slower, but necessary)
```
[2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z] [ClubBot] Fetching settings from Google Sheets...
[2024-01-15T10:30:02.500Z] [ClubBot] Settings fetched from sheets (2500ms)
```

### Cache Refresh (Background)
```
[2024-01-15T10:35:00.000Z] [ClubBot] Refreshing cache...
[2024-01-15T10:35:02.500Z] [ClubBot] Cache refresh completed
```

## Configuration

The cache TTL (Time To Live) is set to **5 minutes** by default:

```typescript
const CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

This can be adjusted based on:
- How frequently your Google Sheet data changes
- Balance between performance and data freshness
- Google Sheets API rate limits

## Monitoring

To monitor cache performance, check the bot logs for:
- Cache hit/miss patterns
- API call frequencies
- Response time improvements
- Cache refresh operations

## Future Optimizations

1. **Redis Cache**: For multi-instance deployments
2. **Database Caching**: For persistent cache across restarts
3. **Smart Cache Invalidation**: Based on specific sheet changes
4. **Preloading**: Cache popular data on startup

## Testing

To verify the improvements are working:

1. **First interaction**: Should see "Fetching from Google Sheets" logs
2. **Subsequent interactions**: Should see "served from cache" logs
3. **Response times**: Should be significantly faster after first load
4. **Button responsiveness**: Should feel near-instant after initial load

The bot should now feel much more responsive, especially for users who interact with it frequently!
